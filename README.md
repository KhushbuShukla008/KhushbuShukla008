# 👋 Hi there, I'm Khushbu Shukla

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and curious **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, and a growing interest in **QA testing** and **AI integration**. I recently completed the **BrainStation Software Engineering Bootcamp**, where I built several collaborative and individual projects from the ground up.
